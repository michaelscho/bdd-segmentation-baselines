# bdd-segmentation-baselines
Kraken segmentation model for detecting baselines in medieval collections of canon law, based on data in [bdd-segmentation-data](https://github.com/michaelscho/bdd-segmentation-data) (https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10882816).
Model was trained using default segmentation as base with default parameter in 50 epochs.
Model was prepared as part of the project [Buchards Dekret Digital](https://www.adwmainz.de/projekte/burchards-dekret-digital/informationen.html), funded by the Academy of Sciences and Literature Mainz. 
Training was conducted by Michael Schonhardt (Universit√§t Kassel, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2750-1900).
